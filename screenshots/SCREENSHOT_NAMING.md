# Screenshot Naming Guide

Based on the screenshots you've provided, here's how to name and save them:

## Screenshots You Have:

1. **Home Page (Dark Mode)** → Save as: `home-page.png`
   - This shows the welcome section with "Welcome to FakeStore Shop"
   - Use the one with the feature cards (the second home page image) as it shows more content

2. **Products Page (Dark Mode)** → Save as: `products-page.png`
   - Shows the grid layout with product cards
   - Has search bar and category filter

3. **List Page (Dark Mode)** → Save as: `list-page.png`
   - Shows products in list format
   - Has search and filter options

4. **Home Page (Light Mode)** → Can be used to show the light theme
   - You could save this as `home-page-light.png` if you want both themes

5. **Products Page (Light Mode)** → Can be used to show the light theme
   - You could save this as `products-page-light.png` if you want both themes

## Still Needed:

- **Detail Page** → `detail-page.png`
  - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/products/1`
  - Take a screenshot of a product detail page

- **Dark Mode Toggle** → `dark-mode.png`
  - Toggle to dark mode on any page
  - Take a screenshot showing the dark theme

## Quick Save Instructions:

1. Right-click on each screenshot image
2. Select "Save image as..." or "Save picture as..."
3. Navigate to the `screenshots` folder in your project
4. Save with the exact filename listed above
5. Make sure to save as PNG format

## Recommended Screenshots for README:

For the main README, we need these 5 screenshots:
- ✅ `home-page.png` (use the dark mode version with feature cards)
- ✅ `products-page.png` (use the dark mode version)
- ✅ `list-page.png` (you have this)
- ⏳ `detail-page.png` (still need this)
- ⏳ `dark-mode.png` (can use any dark mode page, or take a new one)

Once you save these files in the `screenshots` folder, they will automatically appear in your README!
